        "\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line, with each method returning the object itself (typically self). This allows for a fluent and compact style of coding, often used to build or modify objects step by step.   \n",

        " - The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an instance of a class to behave like a function. When defined in a class, calling an instance of that class (e.g., instance(args)) automatically invokes the __call__ method. This feature is particularly useful for creating flexible, reusable, and function-like objects.  \n",
